# .gitignore Explanation

## Purpose
The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and directories to ignore when tracking changes. This prevents sensitive data, temporary files, and build artifacts from being committed to your repository.

## Architecture
The file is organized into logical sections:
1. **Python-specific ignores**: Compiled bytecode, caches, and temporary files
2. **Package/distribution files**: Build outputs that shouldn't be in source control
3. **Testing artifacts**: Coverage reports and test caches
4. **Environment files**: Virtual environments and sensitive configuration
5. **IDE files**: Editor-specific settings that vary by developer
6. **Project-specific**: Our drafts folder and logs

## Key Concepts

### Why Ignore These Files?

1. **Security**: `.env` files contain API keys and secrets
2. **Portability**: Virtual environments are machine-specific
3. **Cleanliness**: Compiled files can be regenerated
4. **Privacy**: IDE settings are personal preferences
5. **Storage**: Large generated files waste repository space

### Decision Rationale

- **`__pycache__/`**: Python's bytecode cache - regenerated automatically
- **`.env`**: Contains sensitive API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY)
- **`drafts/`**: Generated output that users review locally
- **`venv/`**: Python packages specific to each developer's machine
- **`.coverage`**: Test coverage data that's regenerated during testing

## Learning Path
1. Start by understanding why we exclude `.env` (security)
2. Learn about Python's compilation process (`__pycache__`)
3. Understand virtual environments and isolation
4. Explore how different IDEs create config files
5. Consider what belongs in source control vs. what's generated

## Real-world Applications
- **CI/CD**: Build servers regenerate ignored files
- **Team collaboration**: Each developer has their own IDE settings
- **Security audits**: Prevents accidental credential exposure
- **Open source**: Protects contributors' private data

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Forgetting to add `.env`**: Exposes API keys publicly
2. **Committing `venv/`**: Massive repository bloat
3. **Not ignoring IDE files**: Causes merge conflicts
4. **Ignoring too much**: Lost important config files
5. **Wrong patterns**: `*.log` vs `logs/` have different effects

## Best Practices
- Always add `.env` before creating it
- Use specific patterns over wildcards when possible
- Comment complex patterns for team understanding
- Review `.gitignore` when adding new tools
- Check `git status` before committing
