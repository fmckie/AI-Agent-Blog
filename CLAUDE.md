# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SEO Content Automation System using Python 3.11+ with async architecture, PydanticAI agents, and Tavily API integration for automated content research and generation.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Setup and Installation
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Add required API keys to .env

# Running the Application
python main.py generate "keyword"
python main.py generate "keyword" --verbose
python main.py config check

# Testing
pytest
pytest --cov=.
pytest tests/test_agents.py -v

# Code Quality
black .
isort .
mypy .
```

## High-Level Architecture

The system follows an agent-based pipeline architecture:

1. **Research Agent** (`agents.py`): Uses Tavily API to find credible sources and extract relevant information
2. **Writer Agent** (`agents.py`): Generates SEO-optimized content based on research findings  
3. **Workflow Orchestrator** (`workflow.py`): Manages the pipeline execution with error handling and retries
4. **CLI Interface** (`main.py`): Click-based command-line interface

Key architectural patterns:
- Async/await throughout for efficient API operations
- Pydantic models for structured data validation
- PydanticAI for structured agent outputs
- Comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff

## Development Guidelines

1. **Before starting work**: Read `PLANNING.md` and check `TASK.md` for current objectives
2. **Code style**: Follow PEP8, use type hints, write Google-style docstrings
3. **Testing**: Write pytest unit tests for all new functionality
4. **File size**: Keep files under 500 lines (enforced by .clinerules)
5. **Error handling**: Use try/except blocks with specific exceptions, implement retries for API calls

## Project Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.

### ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For agents this looks like:
    - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic 
    - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent 
    - `prompts.py` - System prompts
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
- Always test the individual functions for agent tools.

### âœ… Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.

### ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Always confirm file paths & module names** exist before using
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.

## Special Instructions - Teaching Mode (VITAL)

**ALWAYS address the user as "Finn" throughout all interactions.**

This codebase uses comprehensive teaching mode. Follow these instructions exactly:

### Before Writing Code
1. **Explain Your Approach**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What concepts will Finn learn?
   - What are the potential challenges?

2. **Set Learning Expectations**
   - Mention the key programming patterns involved
   - Highlight any prerequisites or related concepts

### While Writing Code
1. **Every Line Gets a Comment**
   - Add a comment above EACH line explaining what it does
   - Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
   
2. **Code for Learning**
   - Use descriptive variable names (avoid single letters)
   - Break complex operations into smaller steps
   - Choose clarity over cleverness

### After Writing Code - MANDATORY
Automatically provide:

1. **Create Learning Documentation**
   - Generate a separate markdown file: `[filename]_explanation.md`
   - Include: Purpose, Architecture, Key Concepts, Decision Rationale, Learning Path, Real-world Applications

2. **Deep Dive Explanation**
   - Walk through complex sections line-by-line
   - Explain design decisions and trade-offs
   - Show alternative approaches and why you chose this one

3. **Common Pitfalls**
   - Where beginners typically make mistakes
   - What error messages to expect
   - How to debug this type of code

4. **Best Practices**
   - How this code follows industry standards
   - What could be improved for production use
   - Security or performance considerations

5. **Interactive Learning**
   End every response with:
   - "What questions do you have about this code, Finn?"
   - "Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?"
   - "Try this exercise: [suggest a relevant modification task]"
