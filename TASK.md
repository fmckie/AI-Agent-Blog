# Task Tracking

## Current Sprint (2025-01-06)

### In Progress
- [x] Improve test coverage to 80%+ (achieved 79.59%!)
- [ ] Enable and fix remaining skipped tests

### Completed Today
- [x] Fixed test failures in test_research_agent_extended.py
- [x] Fixed test failures in test_writer_agent_extended.py  
- [x] Fixed test failures in test_tools_extended.py
- [x] Installed pytest-asyncio to enable async tests
- [x] Fixed pytest configuration warnings

### Todo
- [x] Improve test coverage for workflow.py (14.37% → 86.23% ✅)
- [ ] Improve test coverage for writer_agent/agent.py (21.74% → 80%+)
- [ ] Run mypy type checking and fix any issues
- [ ] Update README with Phase 7.2 features
- [ ] Add integration tests for full pipeline
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD

- Coverage reporting configured

### Phase 5 - Workflow Orchestration ✅
- Complete pipeline from research to article generation
- Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 4 - Writer Agent ✅
- SEO-optimized article generation
- HTML output formatting

### Phase 3 - Research Agent ✅
- Tavily API integration
- Academic source analysis

### Phase 2 - Project Structure ✅
- Modular architecture
- Configuration management

### Phase 1 - Planning ✅
- System design and architecture

## Discovered During Work

### Test Infrastructure Issues (Fixed)
- Missing pytest-asyncio dependency was causing async tests to skip
- Model field mismatches between tests and actual implementation
- Mock configurations missing required attributes

### Coverage Gaps Identified
- workflow.py needs significant test coverage improvement
- writer_agent module has low coverage
- Many integration tests are skipped due to missing API keys

### Technical Debt
- Coroutine warnings in some tests need addressing
- Type checking with mypy not yet integrated
- No pre-commit hooks for code quality

## Notes

- Test coverage improved from 28.80% to 60.75% after fixes
- 287 tests passing, 0 failing, 160 skipped
- Skipped tests mostly require real API keys or external services
