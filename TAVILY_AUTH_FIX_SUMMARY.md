# Tavily API Authentication Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-09

### Problem Identified
All Tavily API calls were returning 401 Unauthorized errors during Phase 2 testing.

### Root Cause
The implementation was incorrectly sending the API key in the request body:
```python
payload = {
    "api_key": self.api_key,
    "query": query,
    ...
}
```

However, according to the official Tavily API documentation, authentication must use a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

### Solution Implemented

Updated all four Tavily API endpoints in `tools.py`:

1. **Search endpoint** (line 166-195)
2. **Extract endpoint** (line 406-424)
3. **Crawl endpoint** (line 491-515)
4. **Map endpoint** (line 575-595)

#### Code Changes:
```python
# Added headers with Bearer token
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Removed api_key from payload
payload = {
    "query": query,  # No api_key here
    ...
}

# Added headers to request
response = self.session.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
```

### Additional Fixes

1. **Map endpoint response parsing**: Changed from `data.get("links", [])` to `data.get("results", [])` to match actual API response.

### Test Results

Created `test_tavily_auth_fix.py` to verify all endpoints:
- ✅ Search endpoint: Working correctly
- ✅ Map endpoint: Working correctly
- ✅ Extract endpoint: Working correctly
- ✅ Crawl endpoint: Working correctly

### Files Modified
1. `tools.py` - Fixed authentication for all 4 endpoints
2. `TAVILY_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` - Added Phase 2.5 documenting the fix

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify API authentication methods against official documentation
2. Bearer token authentication is different from API key in body
3. Test with real API calls early to catch authentication issues

### Next Steps
- Continue with Phase 3: Advanced Supabase Storage
- Monitor for any remaining 422 errors (likely due to invalid URLs or parameters)
- Consider adding more robust parameter validation
