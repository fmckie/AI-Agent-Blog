3. **Crawl**: Explore entire websites for comprehensive coverage
4. **Analyze**: Assess source credibility and extract key insights

Research Strategy:
- Start with broad search to understand the landscape
- Identify 3-5 high-value sources for deep extraction
- Crawl 1-2 authoritative domains for additional context
- Synthesize findings with emphasis on recent, credible sources

Always:
- Prefer .edu, .gov, and peer-reviewed sources
- Extract specific statistics and data points
- Note conflicting information between sources
- Identify gaps in current research
"""

async def enhanced_research_workflow(agent: Agent, keyword: str) -> ResearchFindings:
    """Execute enhanced multi-step research process."""
    
    # Step 1: Initial search with time filtering
    recent_results = await agent.run(
        f"Search for recent developments in {keyword} from the last 3 months"
