## Troubleshooting & Fixes

### Authentication Issue (Fixed 2025-07-09)
**Problem**: All Tavily API calls were returning 401 Unauthorized errors.

**Root Cause**: The API key was being sent in the request body as `"api_key": self.api_key`, but Tavily requires Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header.

**Solution**: Updated all endpoints to use proper authentication:
```python
# OLD (incorrect):
payload = {"api_key": self.api_key, ...}
response = self.session.post(url, json=payload)

# NEW (correct):
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"}
payload = {...}  # No api_key in body
response = self.session.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
```

**Files Updated**:
- `tools.py`: All four methods (search, extract, crawl, map)

**Additional Fixes**:
- Map endpoint response parsing: Changed from `data.get("links")` to `data.get("results")`

## Project Status

**Phases 1-3 COMPLETED** âœ…

The core Tavily enhancement is now complete with:
- Full Tavily API integration (search, extract, crawl, map)
- 8-stage intelligent research workflow
- Advanced Supabase storage with vector search
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Production-ready implementation

**Phase 4 (Integration & Optimization)** remains as optional future work for performance tuning and production deployment optimization.

This enhancement has successfully transformed our research agent from a basic search tool into a sophisticated research assistant capable of deep, nuanced analysis of any topic.
