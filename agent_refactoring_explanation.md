# Agent Refactoring Explanation

## Purpose
This refactoring separates the Research and Writer agents from a single `agents.py` file into dedicated modules, following the project's architectural guidelines in CLAUDE.md.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Monolithic Structure)
```
agents.py (279 lines)
├── create_research_agent()
├── create_writer_agent()
├── mock implementations
└── patching logic
```

### After (Modular Structure)
```
research_agent/
├── __init__.py      # Module exports
├── agent.py         # Agent creation and mock
├── tools.py         # Agent-specific tools
└── prompts.py       # System prompts

writer_agent/
├── __init__.py      # Module exports
├── agent.py         # Agent creation and mock
├── tools.py         # Agent-specific tools
└── prompts.py       # System prompts

agent_patches.py     # Temporary patching logic
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Each agent now has its own module with clearly defined responsibilities:
- `agent.py`: Core agent logic and creation
- `tools.py`: Agent-specific tool functions
- `prompts.py`: System prompts for agent behavior

### 2. **Module Organization**
Following Python package conventions:
- `__init__.py` files export public APIs
- Internal implementation details remain private
- Clear import paths: `from research_agent import create_research_agent`

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Each agent can be developed and tested independently
- Prompts can be updated without touching agent logic
- Tools can be added/modified per agent needs

## Decision Rationale

### Why Separate Modules?
1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents without bloating a single file
2. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different agents
3. **Testing**: Each agent can have its own test suite
4. **Configuration**: Agent-specific settings stay isolated

### Why Keep Mock Implementations?
The project is in early phases (2/5). Mock implementations allow:
- Testing the overall workflow
- Validating the architecture
- Providing working examples for actual implementation

## Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with understanding one agent module (e.g., `research_agent/`)
2. Trace how the agent is created and configured
3. See how tools are registered and used
4. Understand the prompt's role in agent behavior

### For Intermediate Developers
1. Study the interaction between agents via `workflow.py`
2. Examine how dependencies are passed between agents
3. Understand the patching mechanism for testing

### For Advanced Developers
1. Consider how to implement actual agent logic
2. Design testing strategies for async agents
3. Plan for production deployment considerations

## Real-world Applications

This modular structure is common in:
- **Microservices**: Each service in its own module
- **Plugin Systems**: Each plugin isolated but following common interface
- **ML Pipelines**: Each processing step as a separate module
- **Game Development**: Each game system (physics, rendering, AI) separated

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. **Circular Imports**
Avoid agents importing from each other directly. Use the workflow orchestrator for coordination.

### 2. **Shared State**
Don't share mutable state between agents. Pass data explicitly through the workflow.

### 3. **Over-Engineering**
Don't create too many sub-modules initially. Start simple and refactor as needed.

### 4. **Import Confusion**
Always use absolute imports from project root to avoid confusion:
```python
# Good
from research_agent import create_research_agent

# Avoid
from ..research_agent import create_research_agent
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Clear Boundaries**
Each agent module should be self-contained with minimal external dependencies.

### 2. **Consistent Structure**
All agent modules follow the same structure for predictability.

### 3. **Documentation**
Each module has clear docstrings explaining its purpose and usage.

### 4. **Type Hints**
Use type hints throughout for better IDE support and documentation.
