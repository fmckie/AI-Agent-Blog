  "research_summary": "Recent academic research on blood sugar monitoring reveals significant advancements in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and non-invasive measurement methods. Studies from Harvard Medical School (2024) demonstrate that modern CGM devices achieve 95% accuracy compared to traditional fingerstick methods. Research from Stanford University shows that real-time monitoring reduces hypoglycemic events by 72% in Type 1 diabetes patients. Multiple studies emphasize the importance of personalized monitoring schedules based on individual glycemic patterns and lifestyle factors.",
