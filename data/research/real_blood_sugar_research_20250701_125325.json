  "research_summary": "Recent advancements in blood sugar monitoring, especially with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, have transformed diabetes management by providing real-time glucose data. Regular monitoring is essential to identify fluctuations due to diet, exercise, or medication. CGM devices allow for less invasive monitoring and help prevent complications by facilitating timely interventions. However, the role of regular blood sugar monitoring in non-diabetic individuals remains under-researched, indicating a need for more studies in this area.",
