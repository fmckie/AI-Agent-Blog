## Notes & Discoveries
*Document important findings during development*

- **API Considerations**: Need to add backoff module to requirements.txt for retry logic
- **Model Performance**: Mock agents working well, ready for real PydanticAI integration
- **Common Errors**: 
  - Pydantic V2 migration: Use @field_validator instead of @validator
  - String length validation: Meta descriptions need 120-160 chars
  - Module imports: Ensure backoff is in requirements.txt
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Use async/await consistently throughout the codebase
  - Validate all Pydantic models with comprehensive field validators
  - Create explanation files for each component to aid learning
