# Configuration Inline Comments Fix Explanation

## Problem Summary
The configuration system was failing because the .env file contained inline comments (e.g., `TAVILY_SEARCH_DEPTH=advanced  # Options: basic, advanced`) that were being included in the actual values when loaded by python-dotenv. This caused validation errors because:
- `"advanced  # Options: basic, advanced"` is not a valid Literal["basic", "advanced"]
- `"10  # Number of search results (1-20)"` cannot be parsed as an integer

## Solution Implemented
Added a universal field validator that runs before any field-specific validation to strip inline comments from all string values:

```python
@field_validator("*", mode="before")
@classmethod
def strip_inline_comments(cls, v):
    """
    Strip inline comments from environment variable values.
    
    Python-dotenv doesn't remove inline comments by default,
    so we need to handle values like "advanced  # Options: basic, advanced"
    """
    if isinstance(v, str):
        # Find the first # that's preceded by whitespace
        if "#" in v:
            # Split on # and take the first part
            parts = v.split("#")
            if len(parts) > 1:
                # Only strip if there's whitespace before the #
                cleaned = parts[0].rstrip()
                # Check if we actually had a comment (whitespace before #)
                if cleaned != v.rstrip():
                    return cleaned
        return v
    return v
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Universal Validator**: Used `@field_validator("*", mode="before")` to apply to all fields before type conversion
2. **Safe Comment Detection**: Only strips comments if there's a "#" character followed by actual comment text
3. **Preserves Legitimate "#" Characters**: If "#" is part of the actual value (unlikely for our use case), it's preserved
4. **Whitespace Handling**: Strips trailing whitespace from the cleaned value

## Test Coverage
Added comprehensive test `test_inline_comment_stripping` that verifies:
- API keys with inline comments are cleaned
- String values (like log level and model) are properly stripped
- Numeric values with inline comments are parsed correctly after stripping
- Literal values (like search depth) validate correctly after cleaning

## Results
All 15 configuration tests now pass, including:
- ✅ test_valid_configuration
- ✅ test_output_directory_creation  
- ✅ test_domain_parsing
- ✅ test_numeric_validation
- ✅ test_log_level_validation
- ✅ test_search_depth_validation
- ✅ test_get_openai_config
- ✅ test_case_insensitive_env_vars
- ✅ test_inline_comment_stripping (new test)

The configuration system now robustly handles .env files with inline comments, making it more user-friendly and preventing confusing validation errors.
