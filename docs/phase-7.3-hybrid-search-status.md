# Phase 7.3 - Hybrid Search Implementation Status

## Summary

The hybrid search functionality described in the following checkboxes is **already fully implemented** in the current codebase:

- [x] Create hybrid search function:
  - [x] Check exact cache first
  - [x] Fall back to semantic search
  - [x] Combine results intelligently

## Implementation Details

### Location
The hybrid search is implemented in `rag/retriever.py` in the `retrieve_or_research` method (lines 160-234).

### How It Works

1. **Exact Cache Check** (Step 1)
   - Method: `_check_exact_cache(keyword)` 
   - Checks for exact keyword matches in the cache
   - Returns immediately if found (fastest option)
   - Implementation: lines 180-192

2. **Semantic Search Fallback** (Step 2)
   - Method: `_semantic_search(keyword)`
   - Generates embeddings for the keyword
   - Searches for semantically similar content using pgvector
   - Uses configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.8)
   - Implementation: lines 194-206

3. **Intelligent Result Combination** (Step 3)
   - Follows a waterfall pattern:
     - First tries exact cache (fastest)
     - Then tries semantic search (still fast)
     - Finally calls the research function (slowest)
   - Returns the first successful result
   - Tracks statistics for each type of hit
   - Implementation: lines 208-228

### Performance Tracking

The implementation includes comprehensive statistics tracking:
- Exact cache hits
- Semantic cache hits
- Cache misses
- Response times for each tier
- Error rates

### Test Coverage

Comprehensive tests exist in `tests/test_rag/test_retriever.py`:
- `test_exact_cache_hit` - Tests exact match scenario
- `test_semantic_cache_hit` - Tests semantic fallback
- `test_cache_miss` - Tests fresh research scenario
- Full statistics tracking tests

## Conclusion

The hybrid search functionality is fully implemented and tested. No additional work is needed for these checkboxes - they can be marked as completed.

## Next Steps

If you're looking for Phase 7.3 tasks to complete, consider:
1. Google Drive Integration (as outlined in PLANNING.md)
2. Enhanced hybrid search features (keyword + vector combination)
3. Additional cache management features
