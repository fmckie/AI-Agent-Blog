# Supercharge Your Agent with Web Access Using Tavily


## Overview

This tutorial series is designed for Python developers who want to empower their AI agents with real-time web access, enabling agents to utilize up-to-date information as context. Live web information is critical for AI agents tasked with performing research, answering questions accurately, monitoring trends, or providing up-to-date recommendations. You'll learn how to build AI agents that search the web, extract valuable content, navigate websites intelligently, and integrate real-time web information into private knowledge bases. 

## Agenda

This tutorial series follows a step-by-step learning path with three stand-alone tutorials:
1. In [tutorial #1](./search-extract-crawl.ipynb), we'll cover the **basics of web access**.

2. In [tutorial #2](./web-agent-tutorial.ipynb), we'll **build a web agent** that can search, scrape, and crawl the web.

3. Finally, In [tutorial #3](./hybrid-agent-tutorial.ipynb), we'll develop a system that **combines real-time web information with private knowledge base data**.
