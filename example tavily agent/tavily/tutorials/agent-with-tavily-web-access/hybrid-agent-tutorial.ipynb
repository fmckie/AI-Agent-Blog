    "\n",
    "Welcome to tutorial 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll discover how to build a **hybrid agent** that combines real-time web data with your own internal knowledge sources. For enterprises, the true power of agents comes from integrating proprietary internal data with information from the public web.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrate** web search results and private documents into a single agent workflow\n",
    "- **Enable** your agent to compare, contrast, and synthesize information from both public and internal sources\n",
    "- **Build** more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware applications for research, analysis, and decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why is this approach valuable?**  \n",
    "> It empowers your AI to answer questions with the most current information available online, while also leveraging your proprietary data—just like a human expert would.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> You'll unlock new capabilities for market research, competitive intelligence, and any scenario where both internal and external knowledge matter.\n",

    "        * **If none of the tools return useful information, respond:**\n",

    "Congratulations on completing this tutorial—and the entire series—on building intelligent agents with web access using the Tavily API!\n",
    " \n",
    "Throughout these tutorials, you've learned how to:\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Set up the Tavily API** for real-time web search, extraction, and crawling.\n",
    "- **Design agent architectures** that combine both web and internal knowledge sources.\n",
    "- **Integrate multiple tools**—including web search, extract, crawling, and vector search—into a unified, powerful agent system.\n",
    "- **Apply these agents** to real-world scenarios, such as researching companies and analyzing news.\n",
    " \n",
