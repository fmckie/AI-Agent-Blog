        </div>

        <h2>Traditional Blood Glucose Monitoring</h2>

        <h3>Fingerstick Testing: The Gold Standard</h3>

        <p>Despite technological advances, fingerstick testing remains the most common and accessible method for blood sugar monitoring. Here's how to do it correctly:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare your supplies:</strong> Glucose meter, test strips, lancing device, and alcohol wipes</li>
            <li><strong>Wash your hands:</strong> Use warm water to increase blood flow</li>
            <li><strong>Insert the test strip:</strong> Follow your meter's specific instructions</li>
            <li><strong>Lance your finger:</strong> Use the side of your fingertip, not the center</li>
            <li><strong>Apply blood to the strip:</strong> Let it draw naturally, don't squeeze excessively</li>
            <li><strong>Record your result:</strong> Note the time, what you ate, and any relevant activities</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>When to Test Your Blood Sugar</h3>

        <p>The frequency and timing of blood sugar checks depend on your individual situation. The Endocrine Society (2024) recommends:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> 4-10 times daily (before meals, bedtime, before/after exercise)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes (on insulin):</strong> 2-4 times daily</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes (oral medications):</strong> 1-2 times daily or as directed</li>
            <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> 4 times daily (fasting and after meals)</li>
            <li><strong>Prediabetes:</strong> Periodically as recommended by your provider</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM): The Game Changer</h2>

        <p>Continuous Glucose Monitoring represents the most significant advancement in diabetes technology this decade. A small sensor inserted under your skin measures glucose levels in interstitial fluid every few minutes, providing real-time data to your smartphone or receiver.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of CGM Technology</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>24/7 Monitoring:</strong> See glucose trends throughout the day and night</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Alerts:</strong> Get warnings before highs or lows occur</li>
            <li><strong>No Fingersticks:</strong> Most CGMs eliminate or greatly reduce finger pricks</li>
            <li><strong>Data Insights:</strong> Identify patterns and optimize your management</li>
            <li><strong>Share Capability:</strong> Let caregivers or family members monitor remotely</li>
