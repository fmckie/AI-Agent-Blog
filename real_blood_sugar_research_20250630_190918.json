  "research_summary": "Blood sugar monitoring is crucial for managing diabetes, using devices like glucose meters or continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). It helps track blood sugar levels and facilitates timely interventions to prevent complications associated with diabetes. Studies underscore the importance of regular monitoring for improving health outcomes, personalizing treatment plans, and achieving target blood glucose levels. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the long-term adherence to these monitoring practices and their effects across diverse populations.",
