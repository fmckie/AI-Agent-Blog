  "research_summary": "Recent studies indicate significant advancements and utilizations of Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) in managing blood sugar levels, particularly among patients with diabetes. The University of Colorado's research shows that CGMs can be effectively integrated into primary care to improve patient outcomes. However, monitoring blood sugar in individuals without diabetes remains controversial, warranting further investigation into its benefits. Despite the advantages, systemic barriers prevent widespread adoption of CGMs in clinical practice, indicating a need for focused research on enhancing accessibility.",
