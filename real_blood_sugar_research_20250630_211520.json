  "research_summary": "Recent studies indicate a growing recognition of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as an effective tool for managing blood sugar levels, particularly for individuals with diabetes. Research highlights the successful integration of CGMs in primary care settings, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that such devices can lead to improved health outcomes through real-time tracking of glucose levels. However, significant gaps remain, especially regarding the efficacy of CGMs for non-diabetic individuals and the barriers to broader utilization in primary care.",
