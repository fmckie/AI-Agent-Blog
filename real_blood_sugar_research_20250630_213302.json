  "research_summary": "Recent studies regarding blood sugar monitoring underscore the critical role of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) in managing diabetes. According to research from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, CGMs help patients understand blood sugar fluctuations in real-time, significantly enhancing diabetes management. Despite substantial benefits, less than 50% of primary care doctors prescribe these devices, highlighting a gap in their utilization. Further, discussions surrounding the use of CGMs for non-diabetic individuals raise questions about accessibility and efficacy, necessitating additional research in these areas.",
