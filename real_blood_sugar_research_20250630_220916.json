  "research_summary": "Blood sugar monitoring is crucial for effective diabetes management, providing insights into patient glucose levels and patterns that help guide treatment. Recent CDC guidelines stress the importance of individualized monitoring frequencies based on patient needs and lifestyle factors. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have shown promise in improving glycemic control and reducing complications, underscoring their importance in modern diabetes care. However, there remain gaps in understanding the long-term adherence to and effectiveness of these technologies across diverse populations.",
