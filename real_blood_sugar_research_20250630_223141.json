  "research_summary": "Blood sugar monitoring is essential for diabetes management, enabling patients to track their glucose levels and make necessary adjustments. A recent CDC report indicates that regular monitoring can help patients achieve their glucose targets, significantly influencing overall health outcomes. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time data and have improved glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, there are still gaps in knowledge regarding the long-term health impacts of CGM technology and the socio-economic barriers to widespread adoption.",
