  "research_summary": "Recent studies show that blood sugar monitoring plays a critical role in managing diabetes, with Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) offering real-time data critical for maintaining glucose levels. While CGMs have revolutionized diabetes care, research on their impacts for those without diabetes is lacking, highlighting an opportunity for further study. Regular monitoring can potentially prevent severe complications, but the best practices for non-diabetics remain underexplored.",
