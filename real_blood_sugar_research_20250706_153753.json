  "research_summary": "Recent research highlights the emergence of advanced technology in blood sugar monitoring, such as Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and digital management tools. A study by Zahedani et al. (2023) with 665 participants demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic control through the use of CGM technology. However, while advancements are promising, gaps remain regarding long-term engagement and effectiveness across varied demographics.",
