- Historical building

## Key Concepts

### 1. Research Memory
The agent now understands that all research is preserved and can be built upon. This enables:
- Avoiding redundant searches
- Building deeper understanding over time
- Tracking how knowledge evolves
- Creating lasting research value

### 2. Knowledge Graphs
Research is no longer isolated searches but connected knowledge:
- Sources are nodes in a graph
- Citations and relationships are edges
- Clusters indicate research communities
- Gaps show opportunities

### 3. Adaptive Intelligence
The agent adapts its approach based on:
- Topic classification (6 types)
- Required depth (4 levels)
- Available resources
- Initial findings quality

### 4. Workflow Awareness
Understanding of the 8-stage pipeline:
1. Initialization - Strategy selection
2. Discovery - Broad searching
3. Analysis - Quality assessment
4. Extraction - Deep content retrieval
5. Crawling - Domain exploration
6. Synthesis - Finding combination
7. Validation - Quality checking
8. Completion - Final packaging

## Best Practices

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with search for overview
- Extract promising sources fully
- Crawl authoritative domains
- Build relationship networks

### 2. Storage Utilization
- Check for existing research first
- Build on previous findings
- Update credibility scores
- Track relationship evolution

### 3. Strategic Tool Selection
- Match tools to topic type
- Adjust depth to requirements
- Use comprehensive tool for speed
- Manual tools for precision

### 4. Quality Through Relationships
- Prefer well-cited sources
- Validate through networks
- Track citation consensus
- Identify authoritative clusters

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Medical Research
For a medical topic, the agent will:
1. Classify as "Medical" topic type
2. Prioritize .gov/.edu domains
3. Extract clinical trial data
4. Build citation networks
5. Track evidence hierarchies

### Example 2: Technical Documentation
For a technical topic, the agent will:
1. Classify as "Technical" topic type
2. Analyze documentation structure
3. Crawl official repositories
4. Extract code examples
5. Map API relationships

### Example 3: Emerging Technology
For an emerging topic, the agent will:
1. Classify as "Emerging" topic type
2. Use recent time filters
3. Crawl news and blog sites
4. Track multiple perspectives
5. Identify early research

## Conclusion

The enhanced prompt transforms the research agent into a sophisticated system that:
- Learns from every search
