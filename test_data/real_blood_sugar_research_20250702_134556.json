  "research_summary": "Blood sugar monitoring is vital for diabetes management, utilizing devices such as blood glucose meters and Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs). Recent studies emphasize that structured self-monitoring can significantly improve diabetes control and patient understanding of blood glucose management. While CGMs provide continuous, real-time data, their optimal use remains under-researched. Future studies are needed to explore effective patient education protocols and long-term outcomes of CGM use in diverse populations.",
