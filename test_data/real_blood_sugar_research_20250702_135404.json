  "research_summary": "Recent studies on blood sugar monitoring have underscored its critical role in diabetes management, particularly highlighting advancements in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology. Research indicates that CGMs provide real-time blood glucose tracking, enabling better control and fewer complications associated with diabetes. However, while self-monitoring effectively guides treatment plans, there exists a gap in understanding the long-term psychological effects of using these technologies.",
